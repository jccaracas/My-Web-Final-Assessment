								<p>For me, responsive design is all about website compatibility. It is a graphic user interface (GUI) design strategy that is used to provide information that adapts easily to different screen sizes. The website's design should be responsive and adaptable to all web browsers as well as all sizes of devices or gadgets such as mobile phones and tablets.</p>
								<p>In terms of usability, various devices have different requirements. The Apple iPhone, for example, has "taught" consumers to anticipate to be able to swipe left/right/up/down. People using a smartphone to access a website expect to be able to click a phone number and have their phone provide them the option of auto-dialing that number. Similarly, they anticipate an address to have a "click for directions" option that makes use of their phone's GPS. </p>
								<p>A responsive site considers all of this and automatically adjusts to offer users with the greatest possible user experience regardless of the device used to view the site. </p>
								<p> In general, page elements reshuffle in responsive design when the viewport grows or shrinks. A single codebase can handle users with variable viewport widths rather than building separate sites and codebases for wide-screen displays, desktops, laptops, tablets, and phones of various sizes. Responsive design emerged as a method of assuring equitable access to content across all devices.</p>
								<p> Responsive design is related to web technology. It refers to a site or application design that adapts to the environment in which it is viewed. It incorporates a variety of CSS and HTML capabilities and strategie, it is now essentially how we design webpages by default. Consider the sites you visit on your phone - it's probably unusual to come across a site that is the desktop version scaled down, or where you have to navigate sideways to locate stuff. This is because the web has moved to this approach of designing responsively.</p>
								<p>In developing web applications for various devices, I discovered that it is not enough for my website to simply look attractive; it must also be able to adapt to any screen size and be compatible with all browsers. My website should automatically change to fit each screen size. It encourages simple design that is also SEO friendly.</p>
								<p>This course have taught me web design and development techniques such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. I also learnt about several tools that can be used in web design W3C HTML Validation, for example, is where I check to see if my website has any HTML issues, as well as W3C CSS Validation for CSS. Professor also recommended several websites and videos from where I may learn anything. </p>
								<p>Most significantly, I learnt Javascript, which I used to be afraid of. I have been able to create a different functions and put what I've learnt in my workshops. This is my favourite course since I appreciate both the topics and how the professor interacts with us. </p>
								<p> Overall, the professor taught and helped us to complete assignments and quizzes. He helped us in completing this course successfully. I learned a lot from him and will be able to apply all I have learned next semester. </p>
